This Figma file provides the visual structure and user interface guidelines for the application. I appriciate the designer for the meticulas design considerations.

## Packages Used
## Flutter SVG for Icons
To manage icons in the app, we are using **Flutter SVG**. This makes it easy to modify icon colors dynamically, ensuring that the icons align with different themes and UI states.

## Google Fonts (Poppins)
For consistent typography, the app uses the **Poppins** font from Google Fonts, as per the design in the Figma reference. This ensures that the text styling across the app is in line with the design specifications.

## Navigation with go_router
The appâ€™s navigation is handled using **go_router**. It simplifies route management and allows for declarative navigation, keeping the app's structure clean and easy to manage.

## Countdown Timer with circular_countdown_timer
The app features a circular countdown timer, created using the **circular_countdown_timer** package. This widget visually represents the countdown and fits the Pomodoro timer's core functionality.


## Summary
This project aims to replicate the Pomodoro app's design and functionality as outlined in the Figma reference file. We are using Flutter for development, along with packages such as Flutter SVG, go_router, and circular_countdown_timer to implement key features. The typography follows the Poppins font family, ensuring a consistent and modern look.
